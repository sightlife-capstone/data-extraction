Rate Calculation
================

HCRP Utilization Rate
    "Distributed and used / Source - HCRP Donor tissue used" /
     "Eyes or Corneas - HCRP"

Notification Rate
    "Total deaths in units served during working hours" /
    "Total deaths in hospitals served"

Suitability Rate
    "Potential donors screened by EB staff with doctor, nurse, or medical chart" /
    "Potential Donors initially suitable for transplant"

Consent Rate
    "Consented Potential Donors - HCRP" /
    "Approached Potential Donors"

EDC Productivity
    HCRP transplants /
    number of EDCs


Overall Transplant Utilization Rate
